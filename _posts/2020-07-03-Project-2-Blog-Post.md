#### Prompts: What would you do differently? What was the most difficult part for you? What are your big take-aways from this project?

I'll begin with the take-aways: this project for me really brought together the important steps of supervised learning. Through this experience I was able to appreciate the importance of doing data exploration prior to any modeling, in order to understand the characteristics of the data and their challenges. While a great deal of the underlying mathematics for machine learning can be packaged into various useful libraries, they are no substitute for domain knowledge and a thorough understand of the data itself.

As far as difficulties, I spent more time than anticipated implementing the R markdown automation scripts. I hadn't done anything similar to this functionality in other programming languages, and the logistics of calling one R markdown file from another Rmd file took me a little while to get correct. As a result, I didn't spend as much time as I would've liked to get to know the data (which to me is more interesting than automation). But now that I have more experience with R automation, that task should be more streamlined going forward. Another issue I faced is that my PC is somewhat computationally slow and limited my ability to perform large grid searches in order to tune my nonlinear models. Had I realized this sooner, I would've allocated more time on that part of the project. I also would have liked to learn more regarding feature selection, either as part of ST 558 or outside of the course, and apply this knowledge in a course environment where I could get some feedback.
