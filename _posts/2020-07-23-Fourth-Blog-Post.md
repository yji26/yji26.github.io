#### What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do.

My views on data science have not changed too much from my initial post. Expanding upon my initial thoughts, I'd add that a good data scientist needs to know a wide variety of modeling techniques and which techniques are best applied to which problems. Since this is a relatively young field and new techniques come up quite often, the data scientist must also have the drive to be a lifelong learner.

#### What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not?

R has impressed me in some areas but not others. On the plus side, R Markdown is able to make very good looking reports and analytics documents while having a fairly gentle learning curve. On the other side, I found documentation for a lot of R packages frustrating to read through, and often had to resort to StackOverflow or similar resources to find the answers I'm looking for. Overall, my use of R going forward will be situational, and I would consider using R in place of Python or SAS if the right task comes along.

#### What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

Prior to this course, I have not had a lot of experience coding interactive applications. R Shiny was a good introduction to this domain, and though my job typically uses Python for coding applications, I'll be learning Python packages similar to Shiny (such as Bokeh and Dash) in order to communicate data science ideas more effectively to management.
