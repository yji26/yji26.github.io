title: Blog Post 2 - Experiences with R
---

#### Prompt: Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?  Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

I came to know R through an undergraduate course I took a few years ago. I like that R is a scripting language that does not require a compiler, though that characteristic can slow it down at times. I appreciate that R and its packages are free, and that R is generally at the cutting edge of statistics research and development.

On the flip side, its strong focus on statistics makes R a less viable all-purpose computing language compared to Java and Python, and R is seen as not really production-ready for data science applications. At my company, data science research is done through a combination of R, SAS, SPSS, and Python; on the application development side however Python is becoming the dominant standard for data science-enabled apps and APIs.

The R language has some quirks, though it is overall not difficult to learn, and R Markdown has a lot of nice features that allow it to compete with the likes of Jupyter Notebook. While I like the interactivity of Jupyter better, R Markdown generates great-looking reports that blend text, code, and visuals in an effective way. This course has already provided a lot of valuable R knowledge that I will carry forward in my career, and I can't wait to learn more.
