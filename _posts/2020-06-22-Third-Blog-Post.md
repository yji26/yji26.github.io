#### How is the course going so far? What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course? Any other thoughts?

I think I'm doing well in the course so far. I've liked the thorough introduction to R as a programming language, and the invaluable web resources for the **R for Data Science** and **R Markdown: The Definitive Guide** textbooks which helped a lot. As for improvements, I would have liked to see the course go further in-depth on linear regression and ensemble methods, particularly hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and model selection. In addition, I noticed that in-video check-ins were common at the beginning of the course but have disappeared in recent weeks. But all in all, I'm satisfied with the course direction and materials.
